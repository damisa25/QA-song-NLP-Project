The lyrics of Cruel is I ain't gonna lie
You've been on my mind
I know that it's gonna take some getting used to
And I ain't gonna front
Thought you were the one
Never would've guessed that you would fall through
Baby, 'cause
Each time I tried, girl
You made an excuse
Just tryna avoid it
And hidin' the truth
See, you would rather run away from it
I just wanted you to say something
Still can't believe you'd do me
Like this
How could you take him to
All the places I used to take you to?
I thought you were someone else
Instead you leave me hanging alone by myself
I never thought I'd see the day that you'd be so cruel
Why you playin' games?
Wish it was the same
Probably never gonna be what it used to
But I ain't gonna stress
When there's nothin' left
You gon' up and leave, actin' all brand new
Lady, 'cause
Each time I tried, girl
You made an excuse
Just tryna avoid it
And hidin' the truth
See, you would rather run away from it
I just wanted you to say something
Still can't believe you'd do me
Like this
How could you take him to
All the places I used to take you to?
I thought you were someone else
Instead you leave me hanging alone by myself
I never thought I'd see the day that you'd be so cruel
And I don't wanna make things complicated
Gotta let you know all of this time
I can't get back from you
I'm someone you'll just get over again
I'm tryin' hard to move on
But how could you take him to
All the places I used to take you to?
I thought you were someone else
Instead you leave me hanging alone by myself
How could you take him to
All the places I used to take you to?
I thought you were someone else
Instead you leave me hanging alone by myself
I never thought I'd see the day that you'd be so cruel
