The lyrics of Change is
If there was a picture perfect that would be us
I could be across the world and
I would still have your trust
Don't even gotta question
If I'm the one giving up
But you keep saying you've had enough
So tell me where to go
'Cause I had nowhere to hide
I just want you by my side
But do I still have your heart
Do I still cross your mind
Have we grown apart
Should we even try
I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy trying to find something to do
But everytime I dressed on
That would brings me back to you
So why do I do
I don't know, I don't know up now
See I used to call you
Probably ten times a day
But now you're on the phone
But we've got nothing to say
And everytime I hear our song
It don't sound the same
I don't know if I could do it in not a day
So tell me where to go
'Cause I had nowhere to hide
I just want you by my side
But do I still have your heart
Do I still cross your mind
Have we grown apart
Should we even try
I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy trying to find something to do
But everytime I dressed on
That would brings me back to you
I know things happen for a reason
But I'm tired of this pain I'm feeling
I don't know if I'm strong enough for these changes
'Cause baby
I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy trying to find something to do
But everytime I dressed on
That would brings me back to you
I still keep your picture frame on the side of my bed
Acting like I'm good but I can no longer pretend
Keeping myself busy trying to find something to do
But everytime I dressed on
That would brings me back to you
