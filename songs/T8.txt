The lyrics of Hydrocodone is...
/I'm sitting in my room
I'm all alone now
Missing you
Every single day
I wish you would say
Baby, I love you
'Til I die
But my hopes are gone
/The tainted paint
That's on the wall
Crumbles and corrodes
Rumblin' softly as it hits the floor
It's time to say goodbye
You said this would never end
Guess you played pretend, but it's alright
I know I wasn't good enough
I showed you where it hurts
And for what it's worth, you made it worse
There's always someone better
I hope you find that guy
To make you happy and meanwhile
/I'm sitting in my room
I'm all alone now
Missing you
Every single day
I wish you would say
Baby, I love you
'Til I die
But my hopes are gone
