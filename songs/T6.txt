/La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
/Ever had a feeling that you can't go on
Trying to be strong but getting weaker
Carrying the weight of every single day
Have you lost your way, feeling defeated
/Sat staring, counting spiral patterns on the wall
You wonder if your luck is ever gonna turn around at all
/You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're all alone
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
/Your bedroom carpet stained with Ros√© wine
Empty's left behind, the morning after
The distant purr of cars on soaking roads
And the street echoes the noise of laughter
/The bottom of the bottle, finds you almost every night
You wonder if your life is ever gonna turn out right again
/You need a little light to guide the way
Waiting on the sun to shine again
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
You need a little hope to carry on
In the middle of the night when you're alone
You got to keep your head up high
You got to keep your head up high
